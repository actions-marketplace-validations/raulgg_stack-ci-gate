## Unreleased

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Initial GitHub Action: skip redundant CI on mid-stack pull requests after lower-layer changes and rebases.
- Inputs: `bottom-n`, `run-top`, `github-token`, `pr-number`.
- Outputs: `should-run`, `reason`, `is-stacked`, `is-bottom`, `is-top`, `position`, `size`.
- REST fallback on `opened` / `reopened` when `github.event.pull_request.stack` is missing.
- Remaining-depth lookup via the Stacks API when `bottom-n > 1`.
